# WaveTimo

WaveTimo is a WebGL project that showcases a captivating 3D visualization of a rotating cube and a wavy landscape. The project creates mesmerizing illusions by manipulating the components and leveraging the power of WebGL rendering.

## Project Overview

The main components of WaveTimo include:

- Cube: A 3D cube that rotates gracefully in the scene, adding a sense of depth and movement.

- Wavy Landscape: A dynamic landscape that appears to ripple and undulate, creating an illusion of waves. This effect is achieved by manipulating the geometry of a plane using mathematical calculations.

## Features

- 3D Visualization: Experience a fully immersive 3D environment with a rotating cube and a wavy landscape.

- Illusionary Effects: The manipulation of the cube and landscape components creates captivating illusions and visual effects.

- Real-time Animation: The animation is rendered in real-time, providing smooth and fluid movement.

## Technologies Used

- WebGL: The project utilizes WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within compatible web browsers.

- Three.js: Three.js, a popular JavaScript library built on top of WebGL, is used to simplify the creation of 3D scenes, manage objects, and handle rendering.

- JavaScript: The project's logic and animation are implemented using JavaScript, a versatile programming language.

- Live Server Plugin: The Live Server plugin for Visual Studio Code is used to run the project locally, making it easy to view and interact with the 3D visualization.

## Usage

Now make sure you have Node.js installed.

To run the WaveTimo project locally, follow these steps:

1. Set up a local development environment with Visual Studio Code and ensure you have the Live Server plugin installed.

2. Clone the project repository to your local machine. Then use command "npm install three".

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

4. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.

5. The project will be opened in your default web browser, allowing you to explore the mesmerizing 3D visualization of the rotating cube and wavy landscape.

## Note

While working on this project, I intended to include Perlin noise to enhance the displacement of the wavy landscape. However, due to time constraints, I was unable to implement this feature. Nonetheless, the current implementation still creates a visually captivating effect.

## Credits

The components of this project were created while following along with a book that provided guidance on WebGL development. Three.js was used to simplify the creation of 3D scenes and objects. The Live Server plugin for Visual Studio Code was used to facilitate the development process.
