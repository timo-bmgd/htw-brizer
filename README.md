## The Project

In this project I wanted to create something with displacement on planes. I used the first hours to work through the book,
until I had a good setup.

I found out how to access the geometry on planes, and then took a long time to understand how to manipulate them. I learned how to
animate using the ThreeJS Clock class, and learned to regularly update the normals from the plane so the different lights will have an
effect on the plane, which would otherwise be just one color (which also looked cool..)

I then found a perlin noise generator online, and extended my src with that, and wanted to make good-looking random shapes with that.
However, due to time contraints I wasn't able to do that.

What I like about my project:
- Its simple, but personally I can look at it forever because it's always changing.
- I could very easily create waving flags, which would not take too long, but I don't have enough time sadly.

I hope that you will enjoy the result!
